    "**Stage**: Beginner (Foundations)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Set up and verify your Rust development environment with Jupyter\n",
    "2. Understand Rust's compilation model and execution process\n",
    "3. Write and execute basic Rust programs using print statements\n",
    "4. Identify the key components of a Rust program structure\n",
    "5. Explain the difference between compiled and interpreted languages\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisite Review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Check**: Before we begin, let's ensure you have the basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Do you have experience with at least one programming language?\n",
    "- [ ] Are you familiar with basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)?\n",
    "- [ ] Have you installed Rust, Jupyter, and evcxr_jupyter as per the README?\n",

    "## ðŸ§  Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes Rust Special?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust is a **systems programming language** that focuses on:\n",
    "- **Memory Safety**: Prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferences\n",
    "- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and no garbage collector\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Safe parallel programming without data races\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript), Rust is **compiled**:\n",
    "1. **Source Code** (.rs files) â†’ **Compiler** (rustc) â†’ **Executable** (binary)\n",
    "2. Errors are caught at **compile time**, not runtime\n",
    "3. The compiler is your **helpful assistant**, not your enemy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Rust program has:\n",
    "- A `main` function (entry point)\n",
    "- Statements and expressions\n",
    "- Macros (like `println!`) for common operations\n",
    "\n",
