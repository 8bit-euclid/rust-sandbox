    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain Rust's three ownership rules and why they ensure memory safety\n",
    "2. Understand move semantics and when ownership transfers occur\n",
    "3. Distinguish between stack and heap memory allocation\n",
    "4. Recognize how the Drop trait provides automatic resource cleanup\n",
    "5. Debug common ownership errors and understand the compiler's guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisite Review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Check**: From our previous lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What's the difference between a statement and an expression?\n",
    "2. How do you declare a mutable variable?\n",
    "3. What happens when a function returns an expression (no semicolon)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers**: 1) Statements perform actions, expressions evaluate to values, 2) `let mut x = value;`, 3) The expression's value becomes the function's return value\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Ownership?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ownership** is Rust's unique approach to memory management that:\n",
    "- Eliminates garbage collection overhead\n",
    "- Prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers\n",
    "- Ensures thread safety\n",
    "- Catches errors at compile time, not runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Ownership Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each value in Rust has a single owner**\n",
    "2. **There can only be one owner at a time**\n",
    "3. **When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack vs Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stack**: Fast, fixed-size data (integers, booleans, fixed arrays)\n",
    "- Data pushed/popped in LIFO order\n",
    "- Automatically managed\n",
    "- Copy semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heap**: Dynamic, variable-size data (String, Vec, etc.)\n",
    "- Allocated at runtime\n",
    "- Requires ownership tracking\n",
    "- Move semantics\n",
