- Apply concurrent and async programming patterns
- Optimize code for performance when needed
- Integrate with existing systems and libraries

## 📚 Tutorial Structure

### Three-Stage Architecture
1. **Beginner (Foundations)**: 8 lessons + capstone project (~12-15 hours)
2. **Intermediate (Building Skills)**: 9 lessons + capstone project (~18-22 hours)
3. **Advanced (Mastery)**: 8 lessons + capstone project (~20-25 hours)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### Required Software
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- evcxr_jupyter kernel

### Installation Instructions

1. **Install Rust**:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

2. **Install Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

3. **Install evcxr_jupyter**:
   ```bash
   cargo install evcxr_jupyter
   evcxr_jupyter --install
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   jupyter kernelspec list
   # Should show 'rust' kernel available
   ```

## 🎓 Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Active recall checkpoints (5-10 questions per lesson)
- **Summative**: Capstone projects with rubrics
- **Metacognitive**: Regular reflection prompts
- **Peer Review**: Optional code sharing mechanisms

## 🚀 Capstone Projects

### Beginner: Enhanced Number Guessing Game
- Input validation and error handling
- Score tracking and statistics
- Replay functionality
- User experience improvements

### Intermediate: CLI Data Processing Tool
- File parsing and data transformation
- Command-line argument handling
- Comprehensive error reporting
