# Interactive Rust Programming Tutorial - Complete Specification

## Overview
Create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorial series for learning Rust programming from beginner to advanced levels. The tutorial should be designed as an interactive, pedagogy-driven learning path using `evcxr_jupyter` kernel, with each notebook building systematically on previous ones.

## Pedagogical Framework
**Core Teaching Principles:**
- **Scaffolding**: Introduce concepts gradually, always building on previously learned material
- **Active Recall**: Include frequent checkpoints and quizzes encouraging learners to recall key ideas without reference
- **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit critical concepts (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes) multiple times in different contexts
- **Experiential Learning**: Provide hands-on coding tasks where learners discover concepts through experimentation
- **Project-Based Learning**: Include capstone mini-projects at the end of each major section
- **Metacognition**: Encourage reflection on learning process and concept understanding

## Tutorial Structure

### Three-Stage Architecture
1. **Beginner (Foundations)**: 8 lessons + capstone project
2. **Intermediate (Building Skills)**: 9 lessons + capstone project  
3. **Advanced (Mastery)**: 8 lessons + capstone project

### Standardized Lesson Template
Each notebook must contain exactly these sections:
1. **Learning Objectives** - 3-5 specific, measurable goals
2. **Prerequisite Review** - Quick recap/quiz on needed prior knowledge
3. **Key Concepts** - Core theory with visual aids and clear explanations
4. **Live Code Exploration** - Interactive demonstrations with progressive complexity
5. **Guided Practice** - Step-by-step exercises with scaffolding and hints
6. **Independent Practice** - Open-ended challenges requiring creative application
7. **Active Recall Checkpoint** - Knowledge testing without reference materials
8. **Reflection Prompt** - Metacognitive questions encouraging self-explanation
9. **Preview & Connections** - Links to upcoming concepts and their relevance
10. **Expected Outcomes** - Skills assessment checklist
